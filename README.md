# Multithreaded Web Crawler
A web crawler is a script that automatically visits web pages, extracts data, and follows links. A
 multithreaded web crawler speeds up this process by using multiple threads to fetch pages
 simultaneously

1. Define the Goal- Are you extracting text content, images, or links?- Will you store, index, or analyze the crawled data?
 2. Choose a Tech Stack
 Libraries Required:- Jsoup: Parse HTML and extract data- ExecutorService: Manage multiple threads- ConcurrentHashMap: Store visited URLs- BlockingQueue: Manage URLs to be processed
 3. Build the Web Crawler
 (a) Set Up a Queue for URLs- Use BlockingQueue<String> to hold URLs- The main thread adds new URLs, worker threads process them
 (b) Implement the Crawler Worker Thread- Extracts a URL from the queue- Fetches the webpage using Jsoup- Extracts data (e.g., links, text, images)- Adds new links to the queue- Marks URLs as visited
 (c) Manage Multithreading with ExecutorService- Use Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUM_THREADS) to create multiple threads
 (d) Handle Edge Cases
- Avoid duplicate links using ConcurrentHashMap- Respect robots.txt- Manage errors and timeouts
